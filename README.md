## General info

I watched the beginning of Scrimba's [Mock React Front End Web Developer Interview with Mike Chen and Silvia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7CG7awlrQA&list=WL&index=3&t=391s) thought "I can do that" and then decided to check that I could in fact, do that.

I started this before watching the video, then watched it to see if there was anywhere I could improve. I also went beyond the brief so I could try out Vanilla Extract's features.
